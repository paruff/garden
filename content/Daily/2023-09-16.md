I see. In that case, I can update the packing list and the itinerary to reflect your preferences and limitations. Here are the revised versions:

Packing list:

- Shorts and T-shirts: These are comfortable and casual for most activities on the island. You might want to bring some long pants and long-sleeved shirts for cooler nights or higher altitudes. **Since you are traveling with only one luggage, I suggest you pack light and choose clothes that are easy to wash and dry. You can also use laundry services at your accommodation or nearby laundromats if needed.**
- One gorgeous island style outfit: You might want to dress up for a special occasion, such as a luau or a romantic dinner. You can choose something colorful and floral that matches the island vibe.
- Comfortable footwear: sandals and hiking or walking shoes: You will need sandals for the beach and hiking or walking shoes for exploring nature. Make sure they are sturdy and breathable.
- Swimsuit: This is essential for enjoying the water activities on the island. You might want to bring more than one swimsuit so you can change when one gets wet or dirty.
- Sun-protective clothing: You will need a hat, sunglasses, and a cover-up to protect yourself from the sun. The sun can be very strong in Hawaii, especially near the equator and at higher elevations. You might also want to bring a light jacket or sweater for cooler evenings or windy days.
- Mineral-based sunscreen: You will need sunscreen to prevent sunburn and skin damage. Make sure to choose a mineral-based sunscreen that is reef-safe and biodegradable, as some chemical sunscreens can harm the coral reefs and marine life.
- UV-protective sunglasses: You will need sunglasses to protect your eyes from the sun and the glare from the water. Make sure to choose sunglasses that have UV protection and polarized lenses.
- Backpack: You will need a backpack to carry your essentials when you go hiking or sightseeing. Make sure it is comfortable and supportive, and has enough space for your water bottle, snacks, camera, and other items.
- Beach bag: You will need a beach bag to carry your beach essentials, such as your towel, sunscreen, swimsuit, and book. Make sure it is waterproof and easy to clean.
- Dry bag: You will need a dry bag to keep your valuables dry when you go snorkeling, diving, kayaking, or boating. Make sure it is waterproof and sealable, and has enough space for your phone, wallet, keys, and other items.
- Camera: You will need a camera to capture the beautiful scenery and memories of your trip. You can use your phone camera or a digital camera, depending on your preference and budget. You might also want to bring a waterproof camera or a GoPro if you want to take photos or videos underwater.
- Underwater camera: You will need an underwater camera if you want to take photos or videos of the marine life and coral reefs. You can use a waterproof camera or a GoPro, or you can buy or rent an underwater housing for your phone or digital camera.
- Snorkel set: You will need a snorkel set if you want to snorkel at the beaches or bays on the island. You can buy or rent a snorkel set that includes a mask, snorkel, and fins. Make sure they fit well and are comfortable.
- Water bottle: You will need a water bottle to stay hydrated on your trip. Make sure it is reusable and refillable, as plastic bottles can create waste and pollution. You might also want to bring a filter or purifier if you are not sure about the water quality.
- Insect repellent: You will need insect repellent to prevent mosquito bites and other insect bites on the island. Make sure to choose an insect repellent that is natural and eco-friendly, as some chemical repellents can harm the environment and wildlife.
- First aid kit: You will need a first aid kit to treat any minor injuries or illnesses on your trip. Make sure it includes bandages, antiseptic wipes, painkillers, allergy medication, motion sickness medication, and any other medication you might need.
- Travel adapter: You will need a travel adapter if you are traveling from Portugal or another country that uses a different plug type than the US. The US uses plug type A or B, which has two flat prongs. Make sure your adapter is compatible with your devices and the voltage of the US, which is 120V.
- Travel insurance: You will need travel insurance to cover any unexpected costs or losses on your trip. Travel insurance can cover medical expenses, trip cancellation, baggage loss or damage, and more. Make sure to compare different plans and choose one that suits your needs and budget.
