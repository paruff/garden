### Avoid DCC - Always pay in the local currency 

DCC is dynamic currency conversion. This is where you’re asked by a merchant or when using an ATM abroad if you want to pay in your home currency or the local currency wherever you are. If you choose to pay in your home currency you’ll run into extra fees, and most likely get a poor exchange rate too. Always pay in the local currency wherever you are for the best available deal.
