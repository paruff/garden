[seville walking tour](https://walkawhilewithme.com/seville-walking-tour/)

Spent some time today testing out how to charge our EV , one test was at the EDP charging station and then another session at the tesla station a little ways away.  Then I use [A Better Router Planner](https://www.abetterrouteplanner.com) better routerplanner.com to sort out how to get to Seville and back with the EV and charging while eating and sleeping .

Spending a lot of time on the verge permaculture design course.
