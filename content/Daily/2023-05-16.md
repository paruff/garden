The cork oak montado is one of 35 global biodiversity sanctuaries, similar to those of the Amazon, the African savannah, the Andes, or Borneo . The cork oak forests have over 160 species of birds, 24 species of reptiles and amphibians, and 37 species of mammals, some of which are at high risk of extinction Â¹.

The cork oak is a typical species of the western Mediterranean region and is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate. It grows in soils with a pH between 4.8 and 7.0 Â². However, I couldn't find any specific information about native plants that grow well within the cork oak montado ecosystem.

Would you like more information on this topic or something else? ðŸ˜Š
