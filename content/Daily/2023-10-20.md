    - Cloze deletion flashcards _Template (without notes section)_:
        
                Review Text: "Source text"
        
        Task: Your task is to...(Tell it what you want it to focus on)...and condense the information into concise and direct statements using Anki cloze deletion mark-up. Ensure that each statement is clearly written, easily understandable, and adheres to the specified formatting and reference criteria. 
        
        Formatting Criteria: 
        - Construct a table with two columns: "Statements" and "Number".
        - Each row of the "Statements" column should contain a single statement written in Anki cloze deletion mark-up, focusing on...(What you want it to focus on)
        - The "Number" column should serve to number each row, facilitating feedback.
        
        Reference Criteria for each "Statement":
        - Restrict each statement to 2 cloze deletions. If needed, you may add 1-2 more cloze deletions but restrict them to either cloze1 or cloze2.
        - Limit the word count of each statement to less than 40 words.
        - Keep the text within the cloze deletions limited to one or two key words.
        - Each statement must be able to stand alone. Include the subject of the statement somewhere in the text.
        - Keep ONLY simple, direct, cloze deletion statements in the "Statements" column.
        
        Example: 
        | Statements | Number |
        | --- | --- |
        | {{c1::word}} Give an example of what you want here | 1 |
        | This is a {{c1::second}} example to reinforce the formatting. | 2 |

        
    - Cloze deletion flashcards **************Template (with notes section)**************:



- Prompts for “Two Chat Method”:
    
    Chat instance #1
    
    ```vbnet
    Task: 
    - Transform this dense source text into clear, concise bullet points that will be used to create educational flashcards later. Pay particular attention to the key facts and important details in the text. Focus on imaging features of diseases, unique imaging findings, and methods of differentiating similar disease entities.  Exclude historical and technical information.  This information is trivial and doesn’t contribute to the purpose of the educational materials, which is to help the user become a competent radiologist and diagnostician.
    - Each bullet point must be able to stand alone. Include the subject of the bulleted statement somewhere in the text.
    - Place all the bullet points in a plain text code block.
    
    Source Text: "  "
    ```
    
    Getting responses in a code block allows you to one click copy text.
    
    Chat instance #2
    
    ```vbnet
    Review Text: "  "
    
    Task: Your task is to convert this text into direct statements using Anki cloze deletion mark-up. Prioritize the imaging features of diseases, unique imaging findings, and methods of differentiating similar disease entities. Ensure that each statement is clearly written, easily understandable, and adheres to the specified formatting and reference criteria.
    
    Formatting Criteria: 
    - Construct a table with two columns: "Statements" and "Number".
    - Each row of the "Statements" column should contain a single statement written in Anki cloze deletion mark-up, focusing on the imaging features of disease, unique imaging findings, and differentiating similar disease entities. 
    - The "Number" column should serve to number each row, facilitating feedback.
    
    Reference Criteria for each "Statement":
    - Restrict each statement to 1-2 cloze deletions. If needed, you may add 1-2 more cloze deletions but restrict them to either cloze1 or cloze2.
    - Limit the word count of each statement to less than 40 words.
    - Keep the text within the cloze deletions limited to one or two key words.
    - Each statement must be able to stand alone. Include the subject of the statement somewhere in the text.
    - Keep ONLY simple, direct, cloze deletion statements in the "Statements" column. 
    
    Example: 
    | Statements | Number |
    | --- | --- |
    | {{c1::Necrosis}} in pancreatitis is identified by lack of contrast enhancement after bolus contrast administration. | 1 |
    | Acute {{c1::peripancreatic fluid collections}} are non-encapsulated aggregations of fluid in the pancreatic bed and retroperitoneum.  | 2 |
    ```


Formatting Criteria: - Construct a table with three columns: "Front", “Back”, "Number". - Each row of the "Front" column should contain a single question testing the imaging features of disease, unique imaging findings, and methods of differentiating similar disease entities. - The “Back” column should contain the succinct answer to the question in the corresponding row of the “Front” column. - The "Number" column will serve to number each row, facilitating feedback. Reference Criteria for each "Statement": - Each flashcard should test a single concept - Limit the word count of each question to less than 40 words. - Each flashcard MUST be able to stand alone. Include the subject of the flashcard somewhere in the text. - Keep ONLY simple, direct questions in the "Front" column. Example: | Front | Back | Number | | --- | --- | --- | | How is necrotic tissue identified in acute pancreatitis on a CT scan? | Lack of contrast enhancement. | 1 | | Why should people create their own examples? | Because Jake is too tir
