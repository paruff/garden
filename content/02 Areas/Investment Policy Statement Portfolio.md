Roth IRA, HSA, and taxable brokerage account are at Schwab. Series I savings bonds reside at TreasuryDirect. Savings account is at Wells Fargo. 


Attempt to max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts annually. Contribute to taxable account after that. Keep emergency fund of 6 months' current expenses in savings account. 


Primary objective is to retire at or before age 55. Estimated number to retire is $2 million based on an annual income in retirement of $80k and a SWR estimate of 4%. 


Invest in passively managed market cap weighted index funds for global stocks, U.S. Treasury bonds, TIPS, and gold. Do not buy assets outside of these classes, including but not limited to actively managed funds, derivatives, derivatives-based funds, REITs, individual real estate investment properties, broad commodities funds, and individual stocks. Do not use leverage. Aim for lowest fees whenever possible. Try to allocate based on relative tax efficiency whenever possible. Do not hold gold in taxable space. 


Asset allocation should follow the simple formula of [age minus 20] for fixed income allocation. At 5 years out from retirement, put half of fixed income allocation in TIPS. Maintain half of fixed income in TIPS during retirement. 5% of the portfolio should be allocated to gold at all times, via an index ETF tracking the spot price of gold bullion. Bond duration should be roughly matched to the investing horizon and should be adjusted every 1-5 years. 


Current portfolio at age 30 is: 
VT - global stock market - 85% 
SGOL - gold - 5% 
EDV - extended duration U.S. Treasury bonds (STRIPS) - 10% 


Any change to these assets or allocations will require a 3 month waiting period unless a fund is liquidated by the fund provider and requires immediate replacement. 


Automate new contributions wherever possible. Invest all investable cash as soon as it becomes available. No DCA. No market timing. Rebalance annually around July 1. 


Ignore short-term noise. Don't pay attention to headlines. Stay the course. Keep the long-term view. 


Any change to this investment policy statement will require a 6 month waiting period.
