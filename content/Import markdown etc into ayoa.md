Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a mind map on **Permaculture**:

![Permaculture Mind Map](^1^)

The mind map is divided into six main branches:

1. **Ethics**: This branch represents the three ethics of permaculture, which are Earth Care, People Care, and Fair Share.
2. **Principles**: This branch represents the twelve principles of permaculture, which are a set of guidelines for designing sustainable systems.
3. **Design**: This branch represents the design process of permaculture, which involves observing, analyzing, and planning.
4. **Techniques**: This branch represents the various techniques used in permaculture, such as companion planting, natural pest control, and composting.
5. **Elements**: This branch represents the elements of permaculture, which include plants, animals, soil, water, and energy.
6. **Applications**: This branch represents the various applications of permaculture, such as in agriculture, architecture, and community building.

Each of these main branches has several sub-branches, which are not shown in the mind map. 

To export the mind map in markdown format, you can use a tool like **Markmap**‚Åµ. Markmap is a JavaScript library that can be used to visualize your markdown as mind maps. You can use it to create a mind map in markdown format and then export it to other formats such as .png, .jpg, .pdf, and .svg.

To use Markmap, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Markmap by running `npm install markmap-cli -g` in your terminal.
2. Create a new markdown file and add the mind map in markdown format.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the markdown file is located.
4. Run the command `markmap <filename>.md` to generate the mind map in HTML format.
5. Open the generated HTML file in your browser and take a screenshot of the mind map.
6. You can then use the screenshot to import the mind map into Ayoa.

I hope this helps!
