## **Video 1B-2: A Hook You Didn’t Even See Coming! Learning, Motivation, and Dopamine**

### **Key Concepts**

- Quick review of key concepts from the previous course
    

o Learning means creating links between neurons in long-term memory

o The more we practice with whatever we’ve learned, the more we strengthen those sets of links.

o Nicely connected sets of links in long-term memory make it easy for the “octopus” of working memory to pull those sets of links to mind.

- Whenever dopamine squirts out around our synapses, it helps link neurons together more easily.
    

- Dopamine squirt near synapses whenever we get some kind of unexpected reward. For example, even just through the unexpected reward of having our curiosity satisfied, those links of learning get locked into place!

## **Video 1B-3: Don’t Say Boo—Stress and the Power of the Amygdala**

### **Key Concepts**

- Review ideas:
    

o The brain’s two learning “superhighways” involve the declarative hippocampal pathway and the procedural basal ganglia pathway.

o The Conductor—that is, the octopus of working memory—takes what you or I as the teacher might be explaining to our students and passes that information along to the hippocampus. But Hip can’t face both the Conductor and Neo at the same time. Hip can _only_ help Neo to reinforce her links of learning if the Conductor stops conducting, so he can turn to Neo and help her reinforce her links. This is why short breaks can be valuable.

- The hippocampus can grow and connect neurons more easily than the neocortex can. But the hippocampus’s dendritic spines aren’t very stable—after a few days or weeks, they wither away.
    

- Myg the amygdala is an almond-sized structure located at the end of the hippocampus. The hippocampus helps the amygdala’s emotional input to become attached to a memory.
    

- While most of the data stored in Neo relates to flat, vanilla-flavored facts, without emotional color, the information stored in Myg the amygdala is quite different. It is emotional information. Neural connections to the amygdala may also explain some forms of bias.
    

- The “I’m not biased” bias is a particularly common bias amongst intelligent people.
    

- “Fear conditioning” means conditioning (connecting) something or someone with negative feelings of fear or pain. The brain can be negatively motivated through the amygdala’s “you’d better do this!” _imperative_ system. But fear conditioning isn’t all bad—it can help ensure that students act appropriately in potentially dangerous situations.
    

- Too many fearful events can cause too many spines in the amygdala, which can cause people to misinterpret and overreact to emotional cues—a characteristic of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).

## **Video 1B-4: Digging Deeper into Motivation**

### Key Concepts

- Neuroscience has shown that thinking about rewards in terms of internal and external rewards just doesn’t accord with how the brain works.
    
- _Interrogative_ motivation is the type of motivation that arises because we _want_ to do something—it involves the brain’s reward system.
    
- The _imperative_ system provides for negative motivation through the impetus of the amygdala (and habenula).
    
- Gamification is one of the best ways to bring interrogative motivation into learning.
    
- Motivation often involves what are called “tonic” dopamine molecules that are scattered around the brain. When we have more tonic dopamine, we have more desire to do things. When we have less dopamine, we have less desire to do things.
    
- “Phasic” dopamine molecules are the ones that concentrate around synapses and help us learn.
    
- Gamification encourages inquiry, collaboration, and the exchange of ideas while avoiding unwanted stress that affects students’ abilities. Games also contribute to the enjoyment of learning and allow students to experiment and make mistakes.
    
- Learning is a day-by-day thing. You might not feel like a superhero with the tiny gains that your child is making each day, but these tiny gains can add up into powerful mastery.
    
- We teachers can help our students learn to reframe what they are doing to boost their dopamine levels. Here are some specific ideas:
    

o Make a subject easier through practice and interesting explanations.

o Share passionate excitement about a topic. Emotions are contagious!

o Give ideas for how to reframe the topic to make it seem more palatable. Remind students of long-term rewards as you set, achieve, and celebrate short-term intermediate goals.

o Elicit student curiosity—create a sense of intrigue.

o Establish a sense of shared accountability. Reward teams as well as individuals, for example, for their expertise in problem-solving.

o Use gamification wherever possible to promote mastery learning, rather than simply learning through quizzes and tests.

Week 1 part 2 

## **Video 1B-5: The Disparity Between Intellect and Character**

### Key Concepts

- Sadly, there will _always_ be a significant percentage of bullying or unethical students who are unreachable by current training methods.
    
- Bullies are generally popular kids. They have the highest social status, the greatest self-esteem, and the lowest rates of depression—exactly the opposite of how bullies are typically portrayed.
    

- Because nasty, bullying-type behavior hurts, it can embed in memory all the more strongly, making it seem that the percentage of people who bully is bigger than it actually is.
    
- Just because “everyone” is using a program that ostensibly teaches moral behavior, or the program is developed by professors from a prestigious university with trainers who claim “solid scientific evidence” for the program’s efficacy, does not mean the program is properly vetted using sound scientific methodology, or that it is in fact helpful.
    
- Teachers and administrators can themselves be bullies, both to other teachers and to students. The most competent teachers seem to experience the brunt of the bullying.
    
- Bullying and nasty behavior is not just present in our classrooms. Every discipline has its percentage of nasty people, and, using current training methods, no one can ever completely eliminate that.
    
- Expectations matter. Training students to put their attention on, expect, and ferret out misbehavior in others can make them see such misbehavior in every interaction, which can create a host of new problems.

This massive review notes: “The past decade has seen rapid growth in research that evaluates methods for reducing prejudice. This essay reviews 418 experiments reported in 309 manuscripts from 2007 to 2019 to assess which approaches work best and why. Our quantitative assessment uses meta-analysis to estimate average effects. Our qualitative assessment calls attention to landmark studies that are noteworthy for sustained interventions, imaginative measurement, and transparency. However, 76% of all studies evaluate light-touch interventions, the long-term impact of which remains unclear. The modal intervention uses mentalizing as a salve for prejudice. Although these studies report optimistic conclusions, we identify troubling indications of publication bias that may exaggerate effects. Furthermore, landmark studies often find limited effects, which suggests the need for further theoretical innovation or synergies with other kinds of psychological or structural interventions. We conclude that much research effort is theoretically and empirically ill-suited to provide actionable, evidence-based recommendations for reducing prejudice.”

### Key Concepts

- Any approach to solving problems, particularly when it comes to complex social issues, can produce a cascading stream of resulting difficulties that are worse—sometimes far worse—than the original problem. This concept is informally thought of as the “Law of Unintended Consequences.”
    
- Conventional anti-bullying programs often have unanticipated consequences and side-effects that can make the situation worse.
    
- Surveys can be poor devices for determining whether an educational or social program has achieved its goals.
    
- Bullying isn’t just an act of aggression. It can also be purposeful exclusion.
    
- Seemingly perfect and popular kids can also be bullied—some kids like this have even taken their lives because they couldn’t tolerate the bullying anymore.
    
- Just as kids deserve to be taught how to handle the challenges of reading, writing, and arithmetic, kids deserve to be taught how to handle the social challenges of life, including bullying. It’s important to avoid handicapping students through well-intentioned efforts that have unexpected negative side effects.

## **Video 1B-7: A Deeper Look at Efforts to Eradicate Bullying and Other Harmful Behavior**

### **Key Concepts**

- Bullying that involves a crime such as theft, assault, and vandalism needs to be treated as a crime. Perpetrators of crimes need to be punished and/or properly rehabilitated.
    

- Most bullying is not criminal. It involves insults, social exclusion, and non-injurious physical acts that hurt kids’ feelings. They cause subjective harm, meaning it is up to the victim whether they get hurt.
    
- When we treat acts that cause subjective harm like crimes that require investigation, judgement and punishment, it can simply worsen the situation. The subjective harm can then escalate to objective harm as the vindictiveness turns to physically injurious attacks.
    
- Teaching children how to not be victims teaches important skills that everyone can use throughout life.
    
- Teaching bystanders to intervene in bullying has not been credibly shown to be effective. This approach also encourages a feeling of helplessness on the part of the bullied student. Bystanders can, however, be taught to help de-escalate situations.
    
- Social engineering programs can have results that make the situation worse. Yet the creators of such interventions can be so convinced of the efficacy of their program that they ignore important negative indicators.
    
- Teacher, instructor, and workplace professional development programs are a multi-billion-dollar industry. Like Big Pharma, professional development programs are often the ones funding the studies showing their program’s success. And their narrow definition of success can cover a multitude of worse side effects.

## **Video 1B-8: The Importance of Forgetting in Learning, Life, and Overcoming Stress**

**Key Concepts**

- There are certain neural chemicals that help dendritic spines form and fix into place, and other chemicals that cause those spines to melt away. You need just the right balance of those chemicals to be able to make memories, but also lose memories, so as not to be overwhelmed.
    

- It can be harder for people with exceptional memories to see the big picture. Excellent memories can also be associated with behavioral inflexibility.
    

- Sleep can be a form of “smart forgetting.” Why do we sleep so long? Because disassembling dendritic spines takes time!
    

- Forgetting is important, not only for flexibility, but also for creativity. To see ideas and concepts in new and different ways, we must eliminate some neural connections, even as we make new ones.
    

- It can be deeply unhealthy to remember every experience—especially bad experiences, resentments, and neurotic fears.
    

- It is natural for teachers to want to do whatever they can to help ease students’ anxieties. But beware—asking students to share about negative feelings can be a form of retrieval practice that reinforces unpleasant thoughts and emotions.
    

- Neurogenesis means the creation of new neurons. New neurons help not only with new learning—they also help with forgetting, as the new neurons gradually crowd out lesser-used connections.
    

- One of the best things that we can do to help students overcome stress in their lives is to excite and encourage them about new learning! Learning something new actually serves as a sort of trellis—new neurons have someplace to park and grow if a student is learning something new.
