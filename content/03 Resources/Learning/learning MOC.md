### Summary:


The goal is for someone say a student to identify a knowledge base , and then be exposed to the new ideas and concepts and ba able to remember those idea, knowledge , concepts and apply them to create new ideas kinda like a phd . 

Challenges:
 - biases
 - 
 - forgetting curve

Teaching techniques:
 - analogy
 - visual mind maps

Heard about a book today  "Making it Stick" and the three main points / practices are self quizzing, interwoven , space repetition

 - spaced practice - 
 - interleaving - 
 - retrieval practice -  
 - elaboration - 
 - concrete examples  - 
 - dual coding - visual and other

I had/have been using :
### [[Spaced repetition]]
### [[Pomodoro]]
### Binaural beats 
### [[Mind map]] Mind maps
### [[03 Resources/Learning/Learning by Teaching]] 
Examples/labs or tutorials
