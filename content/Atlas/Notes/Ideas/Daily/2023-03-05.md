Drip Systems are very popular due to ease of installation, but often are not scheduled to run long enough to fully saturate the entire drip zone resulting in a lack of water causing wilting, dropped leaves, and lack of growth. A drip system should be run for 1-2 hours once or twice per week to provide deep irrigation.
