Started our first real road trip with via our electric vehicle. We are charging the car at a Super charging station on our way to algave.

Just added Via Verde to include charging with the tolls and parking services. We also discovered that we will need to speak with GALP to add an EV charging option for the car. We think the EDP charging services are the cheapest , about .15 cents at KWh.
