I surround these entries with square brackets, making them into links. As a result, when I visit the Book note, I’ll see in its links sections a list of all the Books in my vault.\n-   The _author field_ is self-explanatory. The author’s name is linked, which creates an _author note_ for that author.\n-   In my system, _domains_ are the dozen or so areas of study that have sustained my interest over time or in which I have cultivated special expertise. (Examples include divination, fiction writing, and, here, adaptive strategy.) This entry is also linked, so I can track how many times a domain is referenced by various notes and quickly discover other sources and notes related to this area of study.\n-   The _link_ is an Amazon affiliate link. Clicking the link gives me access to all of Amazon’s info on a book. Copying it gives me a handy affiliate link to share when recommending the book.\n-   _Status_ is defined by one of several tags. For books, I use either ToRead for books I haven’t yet read. (When I’m looking for something new to read, a quick search on this tag provides me with a list of options.) Upon completing the book, I change this tag to Completed.\n-   The _recommendation field_ reminds me who to thank (for the good reads) and who to annoy with prank phone calls (for the bad ones). When a name appears here, it’s linked to the note associated with that person.\n-   The _motive field_ provides a place to record why I pursued or how I encountered a source. My motive statement will likely be peppered with links to various domains, other books, etc.\n-   The _rediscovery field_ provides a place to anticipate a situation in which I’d like to rediscover this book. This statement will also incorporate links to domains, other books, events, or even specific dates. (As an aside, I’d like to note that adding the motive and rediscovery fields to my note-making templates has greatly improved the integration and contextualization of my notes over time. If you want to experiment with just one element of my practice in your own, give this one a try.)\n-   The date created field is automatically populated each time the source note template is invoked, thanks to a date code embedded in the template.\n\n\nreference:\nhttps://markmcelroy.com/a-process-for-reading-books-and-making-notes-in-obsidian/","lastmodified":"2022-12-24T19:44:27.313690687Z","tags":null},"/Daily/2022-10-18":{"title":"","content":"[[products/food forest/Pruning]] Pruned the fig and plum\n[[products/food forest/Transplant]]ed a couple walnuts\n\n\nFigured out how to publish my vault on github pages!\n\nGot a phishing email for amazon, discovered [stop-spoofing@amazon.com](mailto:stop-spoofing@amazon.com is the email to send such things to.\n\nI am starting to discover and use #zettelkasten seems there are templates for 3 types of notes, fleeting, literature/consuming and permanetproducting\n\n\nI had two screening interviews today.

Being consistent means setting a clear daily schedule for when you’re going to meditate, and sticking to it except when there are circumstances beyond your control. Diligence means engaging wholeheartedly in the practice rather than spending your time on the cushion planning or daydreaming.\nGoals: Develop a regular meditation practice.\nObstacles: Resistance, procrastination, fatigue, impatience, boredom, lack of motivation.\nSkills: Creating practice routines, setting specific practice goals, generating strong motivation, cultivating discipline and diligence.\nMastery: Never missing a daily practice session.\n\n\n\nTABLE 5. THE SEVEN PROBLEMS AND THEIR ANTIDOTES\n\n\nProblem\nAntidote\n\n\nPROCRASTINATION AND RESISTANCE TO PRACTICING\nFrequently recall the benefits of practice, constantly refresh and renew your motivation, and “just do it.” See Stage One.\n\n\nDISTRACTIONS, FORGETTING, AND MIND-WANDERING\nEach part of the problem is addressed sequentially. In Stage Two, work with mind-wandering. In Stage Three, work on overcoming forgetting. In Stages Four through Six, work on overcoming all distractions.\n\n\nIMPATIENCE\nRather than identifying with impatience, learn to observe it objectively. Cultivate joy, peace, contentment, and equanimity. See Stage Two\n\nMONKEY-MIND\nAn agitated, overly energized mind is in constant motion and can’t stay focused on anything. The antidote is to get grounded in the body. See Stage Two.\n\n\nSELF-DOUBT\nDo everything you can to keep your motivation strong. Don’t compare yourself to others. Make meditation a habit.\n\n\nDULLNESS, DROWSINESS, AND SLEEPINESS\nDecreased mental energy leads to dullness, then drowsiness and sleep. Counter strong dullness by energizing the mind using techniques described in Stages Three and Four. In Stage Five, work on overcoming subtle dullness.\n\n\nPHYSICAL DISCOMFORT\nFind the most comfortable position possible. See Stage One. Use physical discomfort as part of the practice to develop the Insight that pain is inevitable but suffering is optional. See Stages Three and Four.\n\nperipheral awareness - allow sounds, sensations, thoughts, and feelings to continue in the background.","lastmodified":"2022-12-24T19:44:27.317690688Z","tags":null},"/Tesla-secrets":{"title":"","content":"\n1.

[[products/Permaculture Design Course/Introduction to Permaculture ]]– This section and the next lay the foundation with the [[core permaculture principles]] on which permaculture is based.\n2.  **Concepts and Themes in Design –** You might call this portion _How Does an Ecosystem Work?_\n3.  **Methods of Design –** Now we start getting into the nitty-gritty tools and techniques for replicating natural, self-sustaining ecosystems!\n4.  **Pattern Understanding –** Circles, spirals, waves, branches…we see certain patterns over and over again in nature and human designs, but why? What purposes do they serve, and which should be used in X situation?\n5.  [[Climatic Factors]] – These days, when we hear about climate, the first word that probably comes to mind is “change” – but here we’ll be looking at more basic questions.\n6.  **Trees and Their Energy Transactions –** You probably know about the roles that trees play as fuel, raw material, and carbon storage, but are you aware of the many other functions they serve in living forests?\n7.  **Water –** While Earth is called “the watery planet,” humans have tended to mismanage our fresh [[water]] supply, threatening the availability of our most precious resource. Here you’ll learn about how humans have intervened in regional water systems, and how we can repair them.\n8.  **Soils –** Yes, that’s right – soils in the plural! We have so much to say here – where most people see soil as _dirt,_ permaculturists see it as a living ecosystem in itself.\n9.  **Livestock and Aquaculture –** An ecosystem relies on animal integration to benefit itself and us as humans.\n10.  **Earthworking and Earth Resources –** One common remedy for runoff and erosion is earthworking: building berms and digging swales.\n11.  **Strategies of an Alternative Global Nation –** Long before we reach the end of the course, you’ll realize that permaculture offers a whole new guiding vision for human society…and agriculture is just one tiny facet of this vision.\n\nTags:\n#ethics #principles #introduction #design \n\nReferences:\nhttps://billmollison.org/\n\n[Bill Mollison teaching the PDC (video on vimeo)](http://www.networkearth.org/perma/culture.html#Permaculture)\n\n\nhttps://www.edrawmind.com/mind-maps/10829/permaculture-design-certificate-course","lastmodified":"2022-12-24T19:44:27.317690688Z","tags":null},"/products/Permaculture-Design-Course/Permaculture-Ethics":{"title":"","content":"\n A people without an agreed-upon common basis to their actions is neither a community nor a nation.
