Sambucus peruviana\n\nThe latin species name “nigra” means “black”.  Most S. nigra species have black berries.  The name Elderberry comes from the Anglo Saxon word aeld, which means fire.  The hollow stems of the branches were used to blow air into a fire, like bellows.\n\n  \n\n●      Common names and their origins\n\n    Elderberry, Black Elderberry\n\n  \n\n●      Varieties and subspecies of importance\n\nThe Blue Elderberry (Sambucus nigra subsp. cerulea or Sambucus mexicana ) is native to the Pacific Northwest, also known as Blueberry Elder.\n\n‘Aureomarginata’, ‘Black Beauty’, ‘Black Lace’, ‘Purpurea’, ‘Lacinata’, ‘Madonna’ are all cultivated varieties.\n\n  \n\n●      Origin and distribution of the species, where it is native to and where has it spread in the wild, where is it cultivated now\n\nS. nigra is native from in North American and from Britain to Scandanavia south and east to North Africa and west Asia.  It has spread as a cultivated plant to much of the world.\n\n●      Description of form: type of plant, general range of size, rate of growth, life span, flowering, pollination, fruiting cycles\n\nElderberry is a shrub, growing to 8 feet tall with a spread of about 5’.  \n\nIt grows quickly and lives for a medium length of time.  The roots are shallow and mat. \n\nThe foliage is usually green, but there are cultivars that have variegated or black foliage.  \n\nIt produces black berries off of 1st year growth, meaning that it can be cut to the ground each year in the winter and will regenerate from the base in the spring.  \n\nThe flowers are white and appear in late spring - early summer.  The flowers are complete flowers for Sambucus nigra as they have both male and female parts.  They are pollinated by flies and beetles.  The berries are harvested in the late summer to early fall.  The berries are produced each year.\n\n-   Please provide a drawing or images of your plant including:  general form of branching and roots, details of leaves, bark, flowers \u0026 fruit\n\n●      How is this plant cultivated?  What soil type \u0026 pH does it prefer?  Does it grow in sun or shade?\n\nElderberry likes to grow in full sun or partial shade.  It will produce more berries in the sun.  It is adaptable with soil preference but it’s preferred habitat is moist areas that mimic the edge between a forest and a flood plain.  Elderberry is flexible about it’s preferred soil pH, growing in acidic, neutral, or alkaline soils.  There are references that say it prefers a pH range of 6.6-8.  It likes disturbed environments with ample nitrogen. \n\n●      Are there any pests and diseases that affect this plant?  How can these be prevented?\n\nIn general, Elderberry does not suffer much from pest damage or disease.  Rabbits may damage plantings.  It might also be affected by aphids, borers, cankers, leaf spot, or powdery mildew.   Branches may be brittle and susceptible to wind and snow damage.  It can tolerate incidental flooding.\n\n  \n\n●      Multiple Uses: including products and functions/effects\n\nElderberry is a valuable food and medicinal herb for many cultures.  The fruit is most often cooked.  It is used in preserves, jams, pies, sauces, chutneys, and wine.  The berries can be frozen or dried for later use.  Some sources say the berries can be toxic raw in large quantities.  The flowers are aromatic, and lend their flavor to beverages and foods.  They can be eaten raw or cooked.  The flowers can be used to make a natural beverage like champagne or they can be infused to make a homemade St. Germain.\n\n●      Multiple Uses: including products and functions/effects (cont). \n\nMedicinally, Elderberry has been called “the medicine chest of the country people”.  Collected in the fall, the inner bark can be used to treat arthritis and constipation.  It is considered  a purgative, diuretic, and emetic in large doses.  An ointment can be made from the leaves to treat sprains, bruises, and wounds.  \n\nThe flowers are dried for a tea, to lower fevers, reduce chest pain, and bathe inflamed eyes.  A tea from the flowers can also be used as a poultice for easing pain and inflammation.  The flowers are considered to have diaphoretic, expectorant, galactogogue, diuretic, and pectoral properties.  \n\n\n\nThe berries are used as an antiviral.  They can be infused in alcohol to make a tincture, or cooked into a healing syrup for colds and flu.  \n\nThe root is rarely used in herbal medicine now, but it is said to have emetic and purgative qualities.  \n\nOther uses of elderberry include:\n\nThe fruit and the bark can be used as a dye.  \n\nWhile the wood is not used as a timber due to small dimensions, carpenters appreciate the wood for the construction of toys, mathematical instruments, skewers, and pegs.  The wood is white with a close grain. It has valuable cutting and polishing characteristics.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-24T22:01:35.023101686Z","tags":null},"/Projects/food-forest/Pruning":{"title":"","content":"# Pruning\nThree kinds of cuts\n1.
