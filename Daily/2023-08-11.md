Some hardy pioneer species for the Mediterranean climate include Pistacia lentiscusÂ¹ and Rhamnus lycioidesÂ². These species are adapted to dry Mediterranean climate and can tolerate sandy, windy conditions. Pistacia lentiscus is an evergreen shrub or small tree that grows up to 4 meters tall and is native to the Mediterranean BasinÂ¹. Rhamnus lycioides, also known as the black hawthorn or Mediterranean buckthorn, is a slow-growing shrub that can reach 1.5-3 meters in heightÂ².

As for the next and later succession species, it would depend on various factors such as the specific location, soil type, and local environmental conditions. It would be best to consult with a local expert or conduct further research to determine the best plants for your specific situation. However, some general principles for succession planting in a Mediterranean climate might include gradually introducing later successional species as the soil and microclimate improve over time. It's important to note that reaching a climax forest can take many years or even decades depending on various factors.

Unfortunately, I was unable to find information on how long each species will take to mature in the Mediterranean climate. I suggest consulting with a local expert or conducting further research for more detailed information on this topic. Is there anything else you would like to know? ðŸ˜Š

Some examples of pioneer species that can tolerate sandy, windy conditions in Obidos, Portugal include Sand Couch (Elytrigia juncea), Sea Sandwort (Honckenya peploides), Sea Rocket (Cakile maritima), Prickly Saltwort (Salsola kali), and Sea Mayweed (Tripleurospermum maritimum)Â¹. These species are adapted to dry Mediterranean climate and can tolerate sandy, windy conditions. They are able to grow in harsh conditions and are specialized to their environmentÂ¹. I hope this information helps! Is there anything else you would like to know? ðŸ˜Š
