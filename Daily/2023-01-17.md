The best companion plants for citrus trees include wildflowers, nasturtium, lavender, rosemary, and chives. Ideally, companion plants attract pollinators, build soil, repel pests, and are visually appealing. Depending on their shade tolerance, some plants can be planted under the tree itself.

This looks like a workable list to start a citrus guild/companion plant cluster.
