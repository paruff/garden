Solar Pv 

Does the wi-fi light in the inverter blink? Or stays still with a yellow light?

If it stays still, means the wi-fi is connected and it’s the app on your phone that got disconnected, do you use the “SEMS” app or “SolarGO”? 

If it is blinking, check the instructions below to see if the inverter is connected to any wi-fi.

Connect your phone to the solar wi-fi signal, enter that link, and where it says “Router SSID” in the 2nd step, see if you have your wi-fi name on it.
