**Standard Connectivity:**

-   Tesla Over-the-air (OTA) Updates
-   Bluetooth Capability
-   Navigation (WiFi + LTE)
-   Video Streaming (WiFi Only)
-   Caraoke (WiFi Only)
-   Music Streaming (WiFi Only)
-   Internet Browser (WiFi Only)

The majority of the features available in Standard Connectivity can only be accessed via wifi. When your car is out of range of wifi, Tesla’s Standard Connectivity really only includes Navigation and OVA updates. Nothing to sniff at, of course; having your Tesla update itself whenever and wherever necessary is a pretty cool feature.

**Premium Connectivity** (includes everything in Standard, plus the following):

-   Live Traffic Visualization
-   Satellite-View Maps
-   Video Streaming (WiFi + LTE)
-   Caraoke (WiFi + LTE)
-   Music Streaming (WiFi + LTE)
-   Internet Browser (WiFi + LTE)

Premium Connectivity includes two additional features that Standard Connectivity lacks: Live Traffic Visualization and Satellite-View Maps. These two really useful tools are awesome to have both on daily commutes and during road trips.
