Journaling questions from unified Mindfulness teacher training:
Why did you start practicing mindfulness? Were there problems you were hoping it would solve?  
  
● How did you learn to practice mindfulness? A course? Working with a teacher one on one?  
  
● What were some of the challenges you faced and how did you overcome them?  
  
● Before practicing mindfulness did you have ideas about it that later turned out to be inaccurate? Write down what these were and how the discoveries you made through practicing changed your ideas.  
  
● What have some of the rewards and benefits of mindfulness been for you?  
  
● Can you remember 1 to 3 defining moments on your journey with mindfulness? Moments where you had a significant insight, or you made a shift in your relationship to it, or you had a particular experience that brought home the power of practice? It could be as simple as that moment you started practicing consistently or a time you really found yourself able to be in the present moment. Write these down and explore at least one in detail.  
  
Step 2: Go back over it and edit it with the following in mind:  
  
1. An inspirational story builds confidence in your listeners’ ability to meet their objectives. See if you can craft your story so that, at the end of your story, they are likely to feel that what you’ve achieved is doable, even though it may be difficult.  
  
2. Convey the nobility of the goal. Try to shape your story in ways that help them to see the goal of mindfulness as meaningful, desirable, significant, and worth the effort.  
  
3. Describe how things are different for you now that you have been practicing mindfulness.  
  
4. Tell the truth. Each member of your audience has, to use Hemingway’s words, “a built-in, shockproof, crap detector,” and they are likely to detect any exaggerations or falsehoods.  
  
5. Create a sense of closeness with the audience. When possible, convey a feeling of kinship with them. Emphasize how you and they are alike.  
  
6. Make it vivid. Describe the feelings, sights, sounds of your story in detail.  
  
7. Use compelling metaphors and symbols when possible. When Steve Jobs assembled the team that developed the Mac, he didn’t say, “We are here to make a new computer.” He said, "We're here to make a dent in the universe."
