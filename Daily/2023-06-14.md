Congratulations on your new property! Permaculture is a great way to improve soil and create a beautiful landscape. For sandy soil in a Mediterranean climate, some recommended plants include native species that are adapted to the region and can balance crop production with biodiversity functions¬π. Some common Mediterranean herbs that thrive in sandy, well-draining soil with full sun and good circulation include rosemary, thyme, oregano, and sage¬≥.

In terms of planting sequence and timing, it is important to consider soil management practices that can improve soil properties and crop productivity. This can include the application of organic manures, mulch, and crop residues to reduce evaporation losses and increase water storage‚Å¥. It is also important to consider the use of nitrogen-fixing plants and deep accumulators to increase the organic matter in the soil‚Åµ.

For watering schedules, it is important to consider the water balance of your soil. In regions with a Mediterranean climate, the inclusion of cover crops in farming systems is unlikely to have major impacts on the water balance but may still increase overall sustainability of the farming system‚Å∑.

As for a map of where to plant each plant to create a beautiful landscape from the house in the center of the yard, it would be best to consult with a professional permaculture landscape designer or check out resources such as "6 Maps to Draw for Creating Your Own Permaculture Site Design" by Tenth Acre Farm [^10^]. They can help you create a design that takes into account factors such as slope, elevation, and aspect to plan your property for sustainable living and self-sufficiency.

I hope this information helps you get started on your permaculture journey! Let me know if you have any further questions. üòä
