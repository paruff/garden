Here is a list of information that you may want to provide to a landscape designer to get the best results for your yard in a Mediterranean climate on the Iberian peninsula:

- **Climate**: Provide information about the average temperature, rainfall, and wind in your area. For example, temperatures average about 75 °F (24 °C) in summer and 50 °F (10 °C) in winter. Mean annual precipitation is slightly more than 20 inches (500 mm) along the coast and a bit higher in the mountains of the Algarve².
- **Soil type**: Let the designer know that your soil is sandy.
- **Yard size**: Provide the dimensions of your yard.
- **Sun exposure**: Note which areas of your yard get the most sun and at what times of day.
- **Existing vegetation**: Make a list of any plants or trees that are already growing in your yard.
- **Personal preferences**: Let the designer know if you have any specific plants or features that you would like to include in your landscape design.

To collect this information, you can:
1. Look up climate data for your area online or contact a local weather station.
2. Take measurements of your yard to determine its size.
3. Observe the sun exposure in your yard throughout the day and make notes.
4. Walk around your yard and make a list of any existing vegetation.

I hope this helps! Is there anything else you would like to know?

Climate:Mediterranean climate, drought in the summer and some rain in the winter months
Soil type: dirt Sandy
Dimensions: 30m X 70m long /north and 62m short/south the house is 10m X 17 m The BBQ is 5m X 10m in the north east corner of the lot, the access gate is south west corner of the lot with a pump/gate house that is 2m x 2m. There is a wall around the whole property except at the 2 gates in the south east and south west.
Sun exposure: We are in the northern hemisphere. South is to the bottom of the property. We are at lat 38 in portugal near the silver coast.
Existing vegetation:  there is some grass and a few juniper trees, 5 citrus trees and a couple shrub bushes (aliander and something else)

We want to use primarily native plants, ur goal is to have a space for a hot tub a pergola and a swimming pool. We want the yard to be a habitat of birds and other local wildlife. View from the kitchen to have year round color. We want a canopy of local native trees part of the yard. There is a view of the ocean to the north west, Our sunset views to the west and west north are lovely, important, and expansive. There is a lot of wind from the north. Most of the soil in the yard is sandy. We need a solution to the driveway in the winter it rains, and the driveway is muddy, and it can be hard to get to the garage. There are earth works that we inherited from the previous owner which we don’t understand the purpose. The juniper trees in the yard seem almost random in the placement. Most things need irrigation to get started growing. We enjoy our fruit trees in the yard and there is an orchard to the east which had most fruit trees and will be developed in to a food forest.
Views:
There is a view of the ocean to the north west, our sunset views to the west, and west north is lovely, important, and expansive.
There can be a view of the local castle to the west which we hope to be able to view from the second floor west window.
Winds:
There is a lot of wind from the north.
