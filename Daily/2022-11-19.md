## Food forest(Nautilus) Goals

I would like to grow our nutrient dense food and provide a wildlife habitat on our land using permaculture principles generative agriculture.

  

## Vision:

To go a for a walk in the morning and eveningÂ  and collect breakfast and dinner.

Questions for PDC office house:
- list of things to include in the design
- Location of structures
- Water, new seasons
- Wind, should I worry about my wind
- spread of neighbor , spraying ?
- to be / as is

I am  thinking about creating my permaculture presentation in insightmaker.
