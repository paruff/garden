## Water Plan 
 ### Visual
![[Presentations/Assets/Galope-water-plan-23.jpg|700]]

---
## Water Plan

## Swales
 ![[Presentations/Assets/Galope-swales-23 1.jpg|700]]
  - Swale on contour with the rain water pond from the south side of the house
 - Swale on contour up hill of the green line/zone 4 to slow, spread and sink rain water before green/zone 4


---
## Horizontal precipitation 
 - build dew capture system front and back yards to fill rain water capture systems in summer when there is no rain.
 - Wind a large factor for this project

---
## Grey water
 - Engage a plumber to seperate the black for the grey water
 - divert grey water to orchard drip irrigation system

--
# Water Plan (24)


## Seasonal Stream
 - build Dam to slow and filter water
 - line pond 
--
# Water Plan (25)
---

## Access (23)
Adding a serpentine path through zone 2, 3, 4 & 5
Wide enough for an ATV type vehicle to bring supplies to the gardens and forest and wood and yields back to the humans.
---
## Structures (23)
no change

For the garden
![[Presentations/Assets/IMG_1313.jpeg|800]]

Citrus trees

 * Lavender - attract beneficial insects like bees, which are one of the best pollinators
 * Rosemary - 
 * Comfrey - nitrogen fixer
 * Nasturtium - **attract pollinators** and attract [aphids](https://couchtohomestead.com/fruit-tree-aphids/) _away_ from the tree.
 * Chives (alliums) - natural anti-fungal properties, repelling certain pests such as aphids, mites, maggots, as well as rabbits and deer
 * Cover crops - clover - nitrogen fixers
 * Mexican Sunflower - nitrogen when mulched , pollinator attractor
 * Hibiscus (Roselle) -  attracting pollinators
 * Dandelion - fixing nitrogen, protect soil
